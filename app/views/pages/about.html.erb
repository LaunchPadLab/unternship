    <p>We've spent the past 8 years founding and working with non-profits, impact investment funds and social enterprises around the world.  In the hundreds of Skype calls with friends and friends of friends seeking work in the social sector, we heard time and again the challenges people faced in finding meaningful work.  Simultaneously, our organizations were drowning in work and constantly looking for young talent.</p>
     <p>Unternship is an experiment to see if we can't channel more talent into the social sector, while transforming the way organizations approach non-core work and recruitment.</p>
